# Arch Linux Starter

This is designed to get a functional, decent looking Arch environment started along with standard programming utilities.

If you are cloning or forking and not me, you'll need to delete the `.gitconfig`

### Requirements

`git` is the only prerequisite.

### Usage

- Clone or download repository
- Run `sudo ./.setup.sh`
